"""Main-thread cost of a fast streaming reply in the chat renderer.

Four merged PRs moved this path and each rebuilt a throwaway harness to prove it:

    #7892  Streamdown's transition starvation      9.86s -> 0.34s longest freeze
    #8750  incremental Markdown parsing            O(n) per update -> tail only
    #8845  publish coalescing                      4.01s -> 0.62s longest stall
    #8935  incremental fence tokenization          21x fewer characters to Shiki

None of them left anything behind that would notice the next regression, and each had to
rediscover the same methodology. This is that harness, kept.

It drives smoke-stream-pacing.html, which mounts the real MarkdownText inside a real
assistant-ui local runtime, so nothing is a mock of the code under test and assistant-ui's
own update scheduling is inside the measurement. Runs against a vite dev server; no
backend, no auth, no GPU, no model.

The reply is a fixed string. #8845's first measurement attempts failed because a real
model gave the two sides different essays and the renderer's cost is superlinear in
length, so a comparison across different text says nothing.

CPU throttling is not decoration: on a developer machine the renderer keeps up with any
rate this can feed, so an unthrottled run measures nothing on either side.

Chromium only, deliberately. Both things that make this a measurement are Chromium-only:
`Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate` is reached over CDP, which Playwright exposes for Chromium
alone, and `longtask` PerformanceObserver entries exist in no other engine (Gecko bug
1348405 is open; WebKit has never shipped them). Neither fails loudly on firefox or webkit,
since `observe({type: "longtask"})` is specified to abort silently on an unsupported type
rather than throw, so the budgets would read a perfect zero instead of an error. The verdict
below therefore refuses a run that saw no long tasks, and the harness records whether the
engine supported them.

Run:
    python tests/studio/playwright_stream_pacing.py

It starts and stops its own vite dev server. Point it at one you already have with
SMOKE_BASE_URL, or move the port it picks with SMOKE_PORT.
