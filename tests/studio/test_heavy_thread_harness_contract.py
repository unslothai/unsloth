"""The heavy-thread harness must read every guard it records, and must stay portable.

`tests/studio/playwright_heavy_thread.py` measures in a browser and then decides pass/fail in
`main()`. A metric that is recorded but never compared is how a harness goes false-green, which is
the rule already pinned for the #8483 harnesses in test_autoscroll_harness_contract.py.

This file adds the constraint that is specific to this harness: it is meant to run on WebKit and
Firefox as well as Chromium, because Unsloth Desktop is a Tauri webview and not Chromium. Every
CDP counter and the Long Tasks API are Chromium-only, and the failure mode is silent -- a
`longtask` PerformanceObserver on JavaScriptCore never fires, which reads as "no jank" rather than
as "no measurement". So no growth axis and no pass/fail decision may rest on one.
