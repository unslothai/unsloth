"""Source-contract guards for the model-picker per-model-config feature.

These are cheap, CPU-only, no-browser checks that read the frontend source and
assert the specific fixes that got the predecessor PR reverted stay in place. If
a future edit reverts one of them (e.g. rounds the context ceiling up again, or
puts the HF token back in the URL), the matching assertion reddens. They pair
with the runtime Playwright checks (which prove the behavior end to end) and the
backend pytest checks (which prove the backend logic).
