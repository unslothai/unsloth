"""Source contracts for the "stop running chats" confirmation.

The dialog is what a user reads before losing in-flight work, so two things have
to hold: it counts conversations rather than generation handles, and it describes
what confirming actually does. There is no frontend test runner in this repo, so
these read the source the way the other frontend contracts here do.
