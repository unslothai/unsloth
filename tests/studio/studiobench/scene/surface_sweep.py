"""Drive every registered surface once and take a parity digest of each.

THE ONE RULE. A surface that was not reached records a REASON. Never a bare zero, never a missing
row, and never a digest of whatever happened to be on screen instead. The failure this whole tool
is built against is a check that cannot tell "did not run" from "passed", and a sweep is unusually
good at producing exactly that: navigate to /hub, fail to render, digest the chat page that is
still mounted underneath, and report a pass. So every row carries `reached`, `reason`, the settle
observation that decided it, and the root the digest was actually taken from.

WHY THE SWEEP RUNS AGAINST AN EMPTY CHAT. The known state is a fresh `/chat`. Several surface
roots -- the shell, the sidebar, the active route container's siblings -- contain the keep-alive
chat page, so a sweep run against a loaded thread would carry that thread into the digest of every
other surface and any thread difference would flip all of them at once. An empty chat makes the
surface digests about the surfaces.

WHAT THE DIGEST IS. `window.__sb.parity.capture()`, the same function and the same normalisation
the film uses at the close of every action window, pointed at the surface's own root by
surfaces.js. Same function on purpose: a surface digest and an action digest that were produced by
two implementations could not be compared, and comparing them is the point.
