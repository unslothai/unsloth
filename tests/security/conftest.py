"""Shared fixtures for the security regression suite.

The scanner scripts under audit are designed to be offline-safe. Pin
that invariant by autouse-installing a session-scoped network blocker
that refuses any non-loopback `socket.connect()` from inside the test
process. If a future test (or a scanner regression) accidentally tries
to reach the public internet, pytest fails loudly instead of leaking
the request.
