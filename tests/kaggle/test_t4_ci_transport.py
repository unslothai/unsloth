"""What the kernel builder generates and what the launcher can read back.

These cover the transport, not the payloads: the generated driver and payload
cells are EXECUTED here with Kaggle replaced by a stub, so a control-flow
mistake in a cell that only ever runs on a Kaggle T4 is caught on a runner.

No network call, no credential and no GPU: `subprocess` is swapped out
wholesale for the driver cells, and the payload cells that are executed stop
before they reach torch.
