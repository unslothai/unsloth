"""Is this truncated fragment worth continuing, or is the model just echoing itself?

Only asked on the length-continuation path. A turn cut off mid-answer is normally resumed
by handing the partial back and asking for the rest, but a model stuck in a repetition loop
can spend an entire window echoing one fragment, and continuing THAT stitches the echo into
the final answer instead of finishing it. The nudge has to be withheld before it is sent,
not regretted afterwards.

The approach and the thresholds follow NousResearch/hermes-agent's `agent/repetition_guard.py`,
written after an incident where a single turn produced a 60,698-char response delivered as
31 messages. Deliberately conservative in the same way: only LONG verbatim repeats covering
a majority of the fragment trip it, so a sentence cut mid-word, a repeated heading, or code
with similar-looking lines are all still continued.
