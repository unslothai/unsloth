"""The two decisions ``scripts/build_prequant_checkpoint.py`` makes that a bad answer to is
silent: whether a ConvRot build is buildable at all, and what filename it publishes under.

Both end in an artifact that costs GPU-hours and tens of gigabytes and then cannot be resolved
or cannot be loaded, with nothing at build time saying so, which is why they are pulled out as
pure functions and asserted here rather than left inline in ``main``."""
