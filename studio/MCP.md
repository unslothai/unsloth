# Unsloth Studio MCP server

Studio can expose a local MCP server so an MCP client can inspect models and
GPU state, validate recipes, start or stop training, inspect recipe output, and
export a loaded model.

The server is disabled by default. Enable it for a local Studio process with:

```bash
UNSLOTH_STUDIO_ENABLE_MCP=1 \
UNSLOTH_STUDIO_MCP_TOKEN='use-a-local-secret' \
unsloth studio
```

The endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8888/mcp` when Studio uses its default port.
Use the actual Studio port when it is configured differently.

The high-impact tools are:

- `studio_status` and `list_local_models` for discovery
- `get_training_status`, `start_training`, `stop_training`, and `list_training_runs`
- `validate_recipe`, `get_recipe_job_status`, and `get_recipe_job_dataset`
- `load_checkpoint` and `export_gguf`

`start_training` accepts the same fields as the Studio `TrainingStartRequest`.
The request is validated by the existing Pydantic model before a subprocess is
started. Export paths use the existing Studio validation as well.

The endpoint always requires `UNSLOTH_STUDIO_MCP_TOKEN` and checks an exact
Bearer token for both HTTP and WebSocket connections. Keep it on localhost
unless the deployment has an authenticated reverse proxy. The MCP endpoint is
intentionally opt-in because tools can consume GPU memory, write model
artifacts, and stop active work.
