// The widen-only mount window, tested where it is pure. The React glue around it is a .tsx and
// node's type stripping cannot import one, so the parts of the glue that carry a real invariant
// are pinned by source assertion in progressive-mount-glue.test.ts instead.
//
// The property every one of these is protecting: the window only ever grows, and it always
// reaches null. A window that shrank would unmount a message, which is the whole failure mode
// this change exists to avoid.
