/**
Create a keymap plugin for the given set of bindings.

Bindings should map key names to [command](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands)-style
functions, which will be called with `(EditorState, dispatch,
EditorView)` arguments, and should return true when they've handled
the key. Note that the view argument isn't part of the command
protocol, but can be used as an escape hatch if a binding needs to
directly interact with the UI.

Key names may be strings like `"Shift-Ctrl-Enter"`—a key
identifier prefixed with zero or more modifiers. Key identifiers
are based on the strings that can appear in
[`KeyEvent.key`](https:developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key).
Use lowercase letters to refer to letter keys (or uppercase letters
if you want shift to be held). You may use `"Space"` as an alias
for the `" "` name.

Modifiers can be given in any order. `Shift-` (or `s-`), `Alt-` (or
`a-`), `Ctrl-` (or `c-` or `Control-`) and `Cmd-` (or `m-` or
`Meta-`) are recognized. For characters that are created by holding
shift, the `Shift-` prefix is implied, and should not be added
explicitly.

You can use `Mod-` as a shorthand for `Cmd-` on Mac and `Ctrl-` on
other platforms.

You can add multiple keymap plugins to an editor. The order in
which they appear determines their precedence (the ones early in
the array get to dispatch first).
